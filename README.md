# Dynamic-Pricing-Model
This project focuses on building a Dynamic Pricing Model using machine learning techniques, applied to the Auto MPG dataset. The primary objective is to demonstrate how data-driven insights can be used to enhance pricing strategies in industries such as automotive sales, rentals, or fleet management.

The dataset contains various attributes of automobiles including:
Number of cylinders
Displacement
Horsepower
Weight
Acceleration
Model year
Country of origin

The model is designed to predict the Miles Per Gallon (MPG) for a given car based on these features. MPG is a critical factor in determining a car's fuel efficiency, which plays a major role in both customer preference and long-term cost considerations. Once MPG is accurately predicted, we use this prediction to develop a pricing mechanism that adjusts car prices dynamically based on their fuel efficiency and other factors.

The workflow of the project includes:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and normalizing features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing correlations, distributions, and trends to better understand the relationships among features.
Model Building: Using regression techniques such as Linear Regression and Random Forest to predict MPG.
Evaluation: Measuring model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Dynamic Pricing Strategy: Creating a simple rule-based or formula-based pricing model that incorporates MPG predictions to suggest optimized prices.

This project serves as a practical example of how predictive analytics can be integrated into pricing systems to make them more adaptive and intelligent. The approach used here can be extended to real-world applications, where businesses can leverage similar models to price products dynamically based on performance, demand, or customer behavior.
